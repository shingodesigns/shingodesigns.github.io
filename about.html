<p>I’ve been into crafts and sewing since when my friend introduced it to me when I was little. She was quite passionate with fashion and designs I admired her. Since then I’ve been doing several small projects over the years.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I graduated from university that I started challenging myself with larger projects. I’ve started off with making a simple dress for one of my friends, getting into cosplay as well as being in charge of costumes for a kids production. Since then I kept trying new things and improving my skills.</p>
<p>I enjoy creating something unique, one of a kind, something you don’t find at shops. I like to work together to come up with a design and creating your dream.</p>
